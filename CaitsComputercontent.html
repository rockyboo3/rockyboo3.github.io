<strong style='font-size: 12px;'>Hi! I'm Caitlyn Parrish-Lewis...</strong>
<br><br>
I am a sophomore Computer Science and Engineering Psychology student at Tufts University, and I currently work for Veolia as a Drupal Developer!
<br><br>
<strong>I have a drive to create--to apply my classroom knowledge to real world impacts and foster further learning.</strong>
<br><br>To get started, <strong>navigate into any of the folders on the side.</strong> At any time, you can close this tab by clicking the 'x' in the top right, and reopen it by choosing the 'Cait's Computer' icon.
